This is a demo project made by using Node.js,Express.js and MongoDB.
This project is using the live envirenment database from MongoLab.
But I am not sharing the live credentials.
To run the project you have to follow the following instructions:
1) Open command line and navigate to your folder
2) Run foreman start OR node server.js (Assuming you have node.js install)
